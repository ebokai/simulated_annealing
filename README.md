# Simulated annealing community detection

Codebase for simulated annealing to find the best partition of binary variables.

Starting from a random (or pre-specified) partition of n variables into k communities, the algorithm explores the space around the initial partition by proposing elementary modifications. 

1. Merging two communities 
2. Splitting a community in two
3. Switching a node between partitions
